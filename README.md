OCCA is an open-source (MIT license) library used to program current multi-core/many-core architectures.
Devices (such as CPUs, GPUs, Intel's Xeon Phi, FPGAs, etc) are abstracted using an offload-model for application development and programming for the devices is done through a C-based (OKL) kernel.
OCCA gives developers the ability to target devices at run-time by using run-time compilation for device kernels.

## Installing

Using a terminal, go to your OCCA directory
You should see:
   README.md (this file)
   include
   src
   lib

To compile `libocca.so`, type:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/libocca/occa.git
cd occa
make -j 4
```

Python 2 and 3 bindings are also available.
If you wish to setup the occa Python module

```bash
python scripts/make.py
```


## Examples

We have a few examples to show different features of OCCA. The addVectors example contains examples for each current supported language

* C++
* C
* Python

### Compile
To compile addVectors (Hello World! style example) in C++

```bash
cd examples/addVectors/cpp
make
```

### Environment
Setup your library path to point to libocca.so

```bash
# Linux
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH+=':<occa>/lib'
# Mac
export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH+=':<occa>/lib'
```
where `<occa>` is the OCCA directory

## Run
```bash
./main
```

## Status
* Linux and OSX are fully supported
* Windows is partially supported
  * Code is up-to-date for windows
  * Missing compilation project/scripts
  * Visual Studio project is out of date

* OKL Status:
  * Supports most of C
